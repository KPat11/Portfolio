Hello! Welcome to the MemeBot 3000!

I am working on a coding a discord bot to send me memes when requested. We will take advantage of Discord's developer portal to do so and the read/write functionality of the bots.

SETUP:
1. Creating a new application on Discord's developer portal https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Adding a bot to my application
3. Generating and getting a token for application
4. Inviting application to my server

PROGRAMMING:
1. Install and import of Discord libs
2. Log onto Discord server with the bot
3. Running the bot and responding to messages
4. Configuring the bot to send memes via API
5. Cooking up the best memes of the modern age
