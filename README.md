Hi there! Thank you for checking out my work. I am an experienced MLE seeking my next opportunity.
My goal is to demonstrate my programming abilities in the following areas:
- Data Engineering

- Deep Learning
- Python programming

I will be periodically committing my personal projects in this repo. 
Here is what I have committed so far:

Warm-Up Projects:
Demonstrating my foundational understanding of using APIs to create compact, valuable software:

- Building an AI search engine using Exa API
- Using GenAI to create blog posts

MLE-Focused Projects:
