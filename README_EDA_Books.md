Here I worked on EDA for a Kaggle Dataset of Bestselling books from Amazon (2009-2013)

I elected to use Kaggle's API to extract the dataset so if you would like to run the code pleae create an API and follow their steps.

1. use pandas matplotlib and seaborn to manipulate and visualize data
2. chose vscode editor instead of a traditional python notebook just to try something different
